            <p>It was okay. It was kind of boring and Christmas was over so it was not as festive. I related a bit to the main character, but that is it.</p>

              <h4>Review:</h4>
              <p>The first half was trash. There was so many footnotes and the font was so tiny. Howevr, the second half was so good I read it all in one day! This taught me a lot about politics and things minorities go through.</p>

              <p>It was good, but not great. There are a lot of pages, but it feels like not a lot happened. It set the story up for the next book though.</p>

              <h4>Review:</h4>
              <p>Why does this have so much poetry? It's a children's book! This is a really bad book to write an essay on because Alice doesn't really do anything but wander around the whole book.</p>

                <p>This was so much better than the first book! It deals with real world issues that aren't usually published, and the main character actually gets interesting.</p>

                <p>This was basically the same plot as "If You Could See the Sun" by Ann Liang, except this is sports and stand up comedy, not academics and super powers. I didn't like the main character either.</p>

                                    <p>This book was so good, and it had academic vibes that were good for the beginning of the school year. It was a little predictable though.</p>
